# canvas-box-multiplayer

Just a test of boxes in a canvas

You can move with left and right arrow and jump with up arrow.

This works multiplayer with socket io, if any other person (or youself) open the page, it will create another controllable box.

You can try it out in: https://raspichu.moe/canvas_box_multiplayer/
